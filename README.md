# Threadme4T
A python bot that uses twitter API to GET mentioned tweets and send them as Direct messages to the one who tagged the bot. This project uses the tweepy library, since tweepy doesnt support the Twitter API V2 we sometimes used the Twitter API directly without any Libraries. This isnt working as exactly as we needed but its doing the basics thing like sending the tagged tweet etc...
